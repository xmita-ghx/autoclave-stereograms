# autoclave-stereograms
A browser-based AI application that converts standard 2D images into 3D visual experiences. The system uses Computer Vision to estimate depth and Image Processing to generate two distinct types of stereoscopic outputs based on that data. MODE 1: Duplicates and shifts pixels for parallax. MODE 2: Embeds depth map into repeating noise patterns.
